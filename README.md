# JavaScript-Projects

This repository houses my JavaScript projects. 

Project 1: Under the Sea Pizza
For this project I created a pizza menu. This menu will read the selected items and provide the customer with an itemized receipt plus the order total.

Project 2: BlackJack
For this project I created the classic card game BlackJack. The program creates a dealer and player hand by randomly giving each two cards. From there the player can hit(ask for another card) or stay(keep their current cards) depending on their current score. Once the player stays the dealer will attempt to beat the player's score or will bust(surpass the value of twenty one). Once the round is over the player can start a new round and play again. 

Project 3: Find the Rabbits
This project is a game of luck. The goal is to click on the bushes to hopefully find a rabbit. If you find all seven rabbits then you win. If you come across the snake though, you lose. I am still adding to this game.
